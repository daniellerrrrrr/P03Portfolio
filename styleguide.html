          <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Danielle. I'm a design student in my final semester at the school of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University. I have a passion for working with 2D art, illustration, and storytelling, and I'm eager to bring my skills to animation or video game teams and projects. </p>

          <h3>Process Analysis: Beep</h3>
          <p>Graduation project / January - March 2019 / Animation, 3D Modelling / Photoshop, Maya, Unity 3D</p>
            <h4>The Project</h4>
            <p>Beep is a 3D action adventure game where the player controls a round ball that can morph into a cube. Using this ability, the player must evade enemies, retrieve their stolen spaceship, and escape a hostile planet.</p>
            <p>This project is a redux of a game initially created in 2017 for a game design course.</p>
            <p>As a member of the art team, my responsibilities included creating concept art, modelling and texturing 3D assets, and animation cutscenes and characters.</p>

            <h4>Preparation</h4>
            <p>The first task we had to complete was a  review of our previous game. Due to to time constraints and skill level back in 2017, we felt that our resulting game was rushed and flawed, and not quite fulfilling the potential we felt it had. There were a variety of bugs, inconsistency with level design, and weak visual style, narrative, and 3D assets.</p>

            <p>Having identified the problems with our original game, we then worked on additional research and conceptualization. I worked on creating general concept art for new assets and visuals, and worked with the team on brainstorming a narrative that would have a satisfying conclusion for the player. Concept art was made with the idea that we wanted to emphasize the square shapes and rigidity of the game world while contrasting with the round and warm-colour palette of the player character.</p>

            <h4>Implementation</h4>
            <p>Using our concept art as a base, I used proper 3D modelling workflows to create and animate character and enemy models as well as new environment assets. These assets are then implemented into the game world.</p>

            <h4>Problems and Resolutions</h4>
            <p>Our main problem with this project was figuring out how to elevate our old game. As a team, we decided on revising the overall themes, completely discarding and old, hacky work, and redoing them using proper workflows.</p>

            <h4>Evaluation</h4>
            <p>Over the course of this semester, our team has also learned many valuable lessons about self directing and compartmentalizing a team in order to tackle a project with a large scope.</p>

          <h3>Process Analysis: Amorphous</h3>
          <p>Academic project / January - March 2016 / Concept Art, 3D Modelling, Animation / Photoshop, Maya, After Effects</p>
            <h4>The Project</h4>
            <p>Amorphous is a 3D animated short about an astronaut on an alien planet and his encounter with a strange creature.</p>

            <p>This short was created over a period of 3 months for an introductory animation course.</p>

            <p>I worked on the narrative concept, modelling and rigging the main character and a portion of the art assets, and editing together the clips at the end of the short.</p>

            <h4>Preparation</h4>
            <p>The design brief for this project was to create a short 3D animated narrative, using Maya. As a team we got together to brainstorm some ideas, and I boarded out a story about an astronaut that meets an alien who turns out to be a very sinister character. We split the short among our 4 teammates by environment, so each member was responsible for a quarter of the final short.</p>

            </figure>

            <h4>Implementation</h4>
            <p>I was responsible for modelling and animating the astronaut character and the 3D art assets in my scenes. I also rigged and created walk cycles to save my other team members animating time. After rendering out our frames, I edited together my shots, worked on compiling the whole short together, and added visual effects such as the sky, 2D assets, and lighting.</p>

            </figure>

            <h4>Problems and Resolutions</h4>
            <p>The major challenge of working on this project was learning Maya and using it to create an animated short at the same time.</p>

            <h4>Evaluation</h4>
            <p>Overall this project was tough as we had to learn how to use the software as we went along. However, when comparing our final short to our concept art and idea, I’m satisfied that we were able to successfully complete and execute our initial vision. </p>
