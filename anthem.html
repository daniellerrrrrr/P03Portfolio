            <h3>The Project</h3>
            <p>Amorphous is a 3D animated short about an astronaut on an alien planet and his encounter with a strange creature. This short was created over a period of 3 months for an introductory animation course.</p>

            <p>I worked on the narrative concept, modelling and rigging of the main character and a portion of the art assets, and editing together a section of the final film.</p>

          <h3>Storyboarding</h3>
          <p>The design brief for this project was to create a short 3D animated narrative, using Maya. As a team we got together to brainstorm some ideas, and I boarded out a story about an astronaut that meets an alien who turns out to be a very sinister character. We split the short among our 4 teammates by environment, so each member was responsible for a quarter of the final short.</p>

          <div class="space"></div>

          <h3>Art</h3>
          <p>I was responsible for modelling and animating the astronaut character and the 3D art assets in my scenes. I also rigged and created walk cycles to save my other team members animating time. After rendering out our frames, I edited together my shots, worked on compiling the whole short together, and added visual effects such as the sky, 2D assets, and lighting.</p>

          <div class="space"></div>

          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p>Overall this project was tough as we had to learn how to use the software as we went along. However, when comparing our final short to our concept art and idea, Iâ€™m satisfied that we were able to successfully complete and execute our initial vision. </p>
