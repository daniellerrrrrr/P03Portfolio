            <h3>The Project</h3>
            <p>Anthem is an online multiplayer action video game developed by Canadian game developer BioWare.</p>

            <p>My main responsibility over my year-long internship was to board out cutscenes throughout the game. I also completed miscellaneous 2D art as requested from my department.</p>

          <h3>Storyboarding</h3>
          <p>The storyboarding process was a collaborative effort that involved several teams and steps.</p>

          <p>First, I created an initial draft of boards based on a script from the writing team. I then pitched the boards to a team of individuals from narrative, animation, art, and audio departments. The feedback and suggestions I recieved from the team would be then incorporated into revising the boards. Each scene I worked on went through multiple rounds of revision depending on the complexity of the scene.</p>

          <p>The boards I created were used as a visual tool to coordinate with other departments such as writing and level design. Completed boards were then passed on to other departments to carry out the next steps.</p>

          <p>With each new scene and iteration of boards I was able to continuously work on my storyboarding skills: use of cinematography principles, clear composition, draftsmanship, pacing, linking shots together, and pitching and presenting.</p>


          <div class="space"></div>

          <h3>Animatics</h3>
          <p>For some scenes I was required to put my boards together into a animatics. These rough animatics were a way to gauge timing and pacing of the scene, and were also another format used to present to other departments.</p>

          <div class="space"></div>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>The learning experience was a very valuable part of my internship. I learned a lot about the different teams and work that goes into triple A game development. A sense of collaboration runs through everything, and I gained valuable experience working with many departments of various sizes and disciplines.</p>

            THINGS I NEED TO IMPROVE ON: ASSERTIVENESS , boarding skills
          </p>
          <p>It's really cool to see board work I did on multiple scenes incorporated into the game! It was really daunting at first, but I received a lot of support along the way from supervisors and other teams.</p>

<p>
  I think that my greatest accomplishments over the course of my year at BioWare were completing multiple storyboards for the game. Itâ€™s really cool to see work I did incorporated into the game! It was really daunting at first, but I received a lot of support along the way from supervisors and other teams, and
