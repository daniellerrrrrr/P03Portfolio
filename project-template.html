          <h4>The Project</h4>
          <p>Beep is a 3D action adventure game where the player controls a round ball that can morph into a cube. Using this ability, the player must evade enemies, retrieve their stolen spaceship, and escape a hostile planet.</p>
          <p>This project is a redux of a game initially created in 2017 for a game design course.</p>
          <p>As a member of the art team, my responsibilities included creating concept art, modelling and texturing 3D assets, and animation cutscenes and characters.</p>

          <h4>Preparation</h4>
          <p>The first task we had to complete was a  review of our previous game. Due to to time constraints and skill level back in 2017, we felt that our resulting game was rushed and flawed, and not quite fulfilling the potential we felt it had. There were a variety of bugs, inconsistency with level design, and weak visual style, narrative, and 3D assets.</p>

          <p>Having identified the problems with our original game, we then worked on additional research and conceptualization. I worked on creating general concept art for new assets and visuals, and worked with the team on brainstorming a narrative that would have a satisfying conclusion for the player. Concept art was made with the idea that we wanted to emphasize the square shapes and rigidity of the game world while contrasting with the round and warm-colour palette of the player character.</p>

          </figure>

          <h4>Implementation</h4>
          <p>Using our concept art as a base, I used proper 3D modelling workflows to create and animate character and enemy models as well as new environment assets. These assets are then implemented into the game world.</p>

          <h4>Problems and Resolutions</h4>
          <p>Our main problem with this project was figuring out how to elevate our old game. As a team, we decided on revising the overall themes, completely discarding and old, hacky work, and redoing them using proper workflows.</p>

          <h4>Evaluation</h4>
          <p>Over the course of this semester, our team has also learned many valuable lessons about self directing and compartmentalizing a team in order to tackle a project with a large scope.</p>
